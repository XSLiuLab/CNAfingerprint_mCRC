## What is CNAfingerprint ?
CNAfingerprint, A biomarker for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy response prediction in mCRC


We developed and validated a copy number alteration (CNA) based biomarker to predict the effectiveness of oxaliplatin-based regimen in mCRC patients. This machine learning model biomarker was developed retrospectively using competitively low-cost shallow sequencing data, the performance of CNA fingerprint has been validated in three independent test mCRC cohorts. 



## Data details

This data repository stores partial process data for model CNAfingerprint.

The model can be found in [CNAfingerprint](https://github.com/XSLiuLab/CNAfingerprint);

The details of train cohorts (Prediction Scores, Other Information) can be found in /data/Prescore_lable_train.rds;

The details of 3 test cohorts (Prediction Scores, Other Information) can be found in /data/all_test.csv;

The details of non-oxaliplatin cohorts can be found in /data/noOxa_cohort.rds;
