# Introduction

Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is routinely used in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patient, however only about half of patients show clinical response after therapy. Accurate biomarkers for predicting oxaliplatin chemotherapy clinical response are still lacking. Here we developed and validated a tumor genomic DNA copy number alteration (CNA) based biomarker.

In total 271 mCRC patients who underwent primary tumor resection and postoperatively treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy are included in this study. Tissue samples and their clinical data were obtained from the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) and Tongji Hospital of Tongji University. The sample selection criteria are detailed here.
